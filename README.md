### Hi, I'm Yu-Hsin, or call me Becky 👋

I am a first year master student at Carnegie Mellon University studying Information Security. My main interest is system security, currently focusing on reverse engineering. **I just finished a summer internship at Academia Sinica researching post-quantum cryptography.**

- ⛰️ I’m currently applying for summer 2022 internship
- 🌱 Aside from courses of CMU, I am also self-learning cybersecurity by doing Hack The Box and other CTFs
- 🖋️ I also do some [sketching and design](https://www.instagram.com/whaleshark.draw/) (trying to get better)
