### Hi, I'm Yu-Hsin, or call me Becky 👋

I am a Computer Science student just graduated from National Tsing Hua University. My main interest is cybersecurity, focusing on cryptography and reverse engineering. **I just finished a summer internship at Academia Sinica researching post-quantum cryptography.**

- ⛰️ I’m currently applying for graduate programs in Computer Science/Cybersecurity
- 🌱 I’m currently self-learning cybersecurity by attending CTFs and reading books
- 🖋️ I also do some [sketching and design](https://www.instagram.com/whaleshark.draw/) (trying to get better)
